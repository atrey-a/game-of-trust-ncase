# The Evolution of Trust

[The Evolution of Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/) (credits to the creator, [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/)) is an educational game dealing with game theory. This project is a clone of the same, built with PyGame.

## Prerequisites

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is a prerequisite. Also install the [PyGame library](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install pygame
```

It is recommended to view on a display with HD resolution (1366x768) or higher.

If the in-game fonts render improperly (especially in the case of Macbooks), try using [this font (auto-download)](https://boldfonts.com/download/bahnschrift-font/) from [BoldFonts](https://boldfonts.com).
